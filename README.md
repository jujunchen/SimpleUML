# SimpleUML
Intellij IDEA  UML插件 SimpleUML，反编译源码

# 起因
由于SimpleUML自0.1版本开始就再没有发布过新版本，随着IDEA版本的更新，原来的插件已经不太好用，所以，我决定反编译插件源码，并发布到gitHub上。

# 后续计划
对SimpleUML做一些适应性维护，修复现有的一些BUG，以适配现在的IDEA新版本。大家也可以fork源码，参与进来，或者发布Issues。

# 版本修复
2024.6.14 上传反编译源码，能跑起来，有不少问题

# Reason
Since no new version of SimpleUML has been released since its 0.1 version, the original plugin has become less functional with the updates of IntelliJ IDEA. Therefore, I decided to reverse engineer the plugin's source code and release it on GitHub.

# Future Plans
I will perform some adaptive maintenance on SimpleUML, fixing existing bugs to make it compatible with the current new versions of IntelliJ IDEA. You can also fork the source code, participate in the development, or submit issues.

# Version Update
On June 14, 2024, I uploaded the reverse-engineered source code, which can run but still has many issues.
